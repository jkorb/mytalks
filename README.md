# mytalks

This repository hosts a bibliographical database of my academic talks in different formats (`.bib`, `.bibtex`, `.json`, `.yaml`).

## Syncing

The repository contains a primitive bash script `sync.sh` for syncing between the different formats using `pandoc`.
It's mainly for my personal use, but in case you're interested have a look.
