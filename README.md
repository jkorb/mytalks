This repository hosts a bibliographical database of my academic talks in different formats (`.bib`, `.bibtex`, `.json`, `.yaml`).
You can find a compiled list of my presentations in PDF [here](https://github.com/jkorb/mytalks/releases/download/release/mytalks.pdf).

## Syncing

The repository contains a primitive bash script `sync.sh` for syncing between the different formats using `pandoc`.
It's mainly for my personal use, but in case you're interested have a look.

## License

Bibliographies are not copyrightable (luckily).

The rest, of the project is under the MIT license.
